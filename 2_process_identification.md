# Process Identification

First step in the lifecycle

identify all the processes and decide on which we want to act first

## What is important

> * __SLIDES__

## Process architecture

* Captures business processes and their scope
* Serves as a framework for defining priorities and scope of subsequent BPM phases

## Processes change over time

* Process identification is exploratory and iterative
* Improvement opportunities are time constrained

## Process Identification Steps

### Designation Phase

What should i consider a Process?

#### Process enumeration

> 1. Selling stuff
> 2. Deliver Stuff
> 3. Making sure you have stuff to sell and deliver

In reality do we want to be broad or narrow in our designation phase? designation is expensive

The model previously shown is too small, it does not catch every aspect of the processes involved

We need to balance between the impact and manageability of our analysis

> Rule of thump => between 10-20 processes with exceptions

#### Types of Processes

Porter cathegorization

* Core processes
  * Direct procurement (_Buying from the suppliers_)
  * Selling to Stakeholders
* Support Processes
  * HR (_human resources_)
  * Indirect procurement
* Management Processes
  * Sign Contracts
  * Decision making processes
  * Logistic management

#### Relationship between processes

* Horizontal
* Vertical
* Specialization

##### Horizontal

* Chain of processes and organization performs to deliver value to customers and stakeholders
* a mechanism to group high-level business processes according to an order relation

e.g. Procure-to-service

> __IMAGE FROM SLIDES__

e.g. Wholesaler

> __IMAGE FROM SLIDES__

__main steps__:

* Source
* Make
* Deliver
* Service

How to identify horizontal boundaries in value chains:

* Change of key business object in the process
* Change of granularity of main business object
* Change in frequency/time
* Change in intermediate outcome/resolution/objective
* Core processes
  * decompose by identifying intermediate outcomes
* Support processes
* Management processes

###### Case/Function Matrix

1. Identify case types
2. Identify function for case types
3. Construct one or more function matrices
4. Identify processes

##### Vertical
