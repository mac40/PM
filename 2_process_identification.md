## Process Identification Steps

### Designation Phase

What should i consider a Process?

#### Process enumeration

> 1. Selling stuff
> 2. Deliver Stuff
> 3. Making sure you have stuff to sell and deliver

In reality do we want to be broad or narrow in our designation phase? designation is expensive

The model previously shown is too small, it does not catch every aspect of the processes involved

We need to balance between the impact and manageability of our analysis

> Rule of thump => between 10-20 processes with exceptions
